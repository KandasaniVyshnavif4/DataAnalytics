This is my first data analysis projrct . It is a learing project .
I will explain all the steps that I have done in this project.
Download  a data set 
bofore clickig on load click on transform to remove unwanted columns
We make the use of power Query editor, It provides more functionalty for manupulating the data
load the data in the Excel sheet  using " DATA " ->  file/csv  -> load
the data is loaded in the sheet.
now create new coums on your requirement
After transform raw data into an organised data we need to create dashboard
raw date ->> data cleaning "using transform -> load "->> creating new columns accordingly -->> pivote "creating infromation from data" -> creating dashborad "pictorial representation of data"
